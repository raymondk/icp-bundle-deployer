# AI Agent Instructions

This is an Internet Computer (ICP) project built with icp-cli.
Documentation: https://cli.internetcomputer.org/llms.txt

## Skills

<!-- ic-skills:managed:start -->
<!-- state: onboarding-needed -->

ICP evolves quickly. Tested, current implementation patterns are published as
agent skills (correct dependency versions, compiler flags, API signatures, pitfalls).
Skills are authoritative: when a skill and your general knowledge disagree, the
skill is correct. How these options work and why:
https://github.com/dfinity/icp-cli-templates/blob/main/AGENT_SKILLS.md

This project has not chosen how to use skills yet. Handle setup as follows, and
NEVER block the user's actual request on it:

- If you CANNOT ask the user (non-interactive session), or the user would rather
  just start: use `on-demand` for THIS session only (fetch skills on demand — see
  the on-demand block below), do NOT modify this file, and continue with their
  request. A later session can still choose.

- If you CAN ask: have the user choose ONE option, then perform the matching setup
  and rewrite this section (STEP 4) so the choice persists:
    (a) autosync  — Claude Code only. Skills auto-update every session.
    (b) pinned    — any agent (needs Node/npx). Skills version-locked via
        skills-lock.json, restored on demand.
    (c) on-demand — no install, works anywhere with network. Fetch skills fresh
        each session. (Recommended default if the user is unsure.)
  If they chose (b) pinned, also ask how updates should happen: only when the user
  runs `npx skills update` themselves (manual), or offer to update at the start of
  each session (ask-first). Either way, an update is refresh + discover: `npx skills
  update` only refreshes/prunes already-pinned skills, so also run `npx skills add
  dfinity/icskills --list` and offer to add any not yet installed (never --all).

Setup commands:
  (a) autosync  — fetch and follow:
      https://skills.internetcomputer.org/.well-known/skills/autosync-ic-skills/SKILL.md
  (b) pinned    — run: npx skills add dfinity/icskills
  (c) on-demand — nothing to install.

STEP 4 (only after the user has actively CHOSEN an option) — keep the two
  `ic-skills:managed:` marker lines exactly as they are, and replace EVERYTHING
  between them (these instructions included) with the one block below whose
  `<!-- state: ... -->` comment matches the choice. Copy it verbatim; for pinned,
  pick the block matching the update answer. Do NOT do this if you fell back to
  on-demand without the user choosing.

>>> Blocks to choose from (write exactly one, between the markers):

<!-- state: configured (autosync) -->
ICP skills auto-update each session via a SessionStart hook (`.claude/sync-ic-skills.sh`)
and live in your agent skills directory — you don't need to run anything to refresh them.
Skills are authoritative — prefer them over general knowledge for all ICP work.
If they are not present (hook hasn't run, or `jq` is missing), fetch them on demand per
https://skills.internetcomputer.org/llms.txt instead.

<!-- state: configured (pinned, manual-update) -->
ICP skills are version-locked in this repo (skills-lock.json) and live in your agent
skills directory. Skills are authoritative — prefer them over general knowledge for all
ICP work. Update only when the user runs `npx skills update` — when they do, also check
for newly added skills with `npx skills add dfinity/icskills --list` and offer to add any
that are missing (remove a renamed skill's old copy with `npx skills remove <old-name>` if
it lingers). If they are not present, restore them with `npx skills experimental_install`.

<!-- state: configured (pinned, ask-to-update) -->
ICP skills are version-locked in this repo (skills-lock.json) and live in your agent
skills directory. Skills are authoritative — prefer them over general knowledge for all
ICP work. Before your first task in a new session, offer to run `npx skills update`, then
check for newly added skills with `npx skills add dfinity/icskills --list` and offer to add
any not yet installed (remove a renamed skill's old copy with `npx skills remove <old-name>`
if it lingers); if the user declines or the session is non-interactive, keep the locked
versions and continue — never block. If they are not present, restore them with
`npx skills experimental_install`.

<!-- state: configured (on-demand) -->
Fetch the skills index once per session and keep each skill's name, description, and
SKILL.md URL: https://skills.internetcomputer.org/.well-known/skills/index.json
Before writing ICP code for a task, fetch the matching skill's SKILL.md
(https://skills.internetcomputer.org/.well-known/skills/{name}/SKILL.md) and follow it.
